ASSIGNEMENT DAY -04



Question-01
In the binary search algorithm,it is suggested to calculate the mid as 
beg+(end-beg)/2 instead of (beg+end)/2 why is it so? 
sol:if the value of start or end or both is int max,it will cause integer overflow


Question-02
write the algorithm/function for ternary search?
sol:f(m1)<f(m2)  [l;m1]
    f(m1)>f(m2)  [l;m2]
    f(m1)=f(m2)  [m1;m2]
         
    m1=l+(r-l)/3
    m2=r-(r-l)/3
